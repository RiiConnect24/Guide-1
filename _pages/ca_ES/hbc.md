The Homebrew Channel is where you will go to launch homebrew applications. BootMii is a piece of software that can backup and restore your Wii's NAND storage, and if installed in boot2, provides brick protection.

#### Instruccions

1. You will see a scam warning screen. Wait 30 seconds for the text "Press 1 to continue" to appear, then press 1. ![Scam Screen](/images/Wii/ScamScreen.png)

2. When at the HackMii installer, you are able to install the Homebrew Channel and BootMii. ![Results](/images/Wii/Results.png)

5. Once installed, press back and go to BootMii.
6. If the main screen says you can install as boot2, do so. This gives you a level of brick protection that loads as part of the Wii's boot process, and lets you load homebrew to fix the brick or restore from a NAND backup.
7. If it does not say you can install as boot2, install as IOS. While this doesn't give you any brick protection, you will still be able to make a NAND backup.
