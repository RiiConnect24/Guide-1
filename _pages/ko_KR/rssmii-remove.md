If you no longer wish to use RSSMii (maybe because it gives you too much Wii Mail), here's how to remove it.

![Removing RSSMii](/images/rssmii-remove.png)

#### 필요한 것

* An SD card
* [RSSMii Remover](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/rssmii/releases)

#### 방법

1. Extract RSSMii Remover and put it in the `apps` folder on your SD card.
2. Delete the `feeds.xml` file on the root of your SD card.
3. Launch RSSMii Remover from the Homebrew Channel. It will remove your subscriptions to the RSS feeds.

In case you would like to revert your decision, you can always [reinstall RSSMii](rssmii).
