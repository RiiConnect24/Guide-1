1. Unzip the EVCPatcher.
1. On Windows, launch patcher.bat. On Unix, use patcher.sh. Make sure you installed mono on Unix.
1. Wait while the EVCPatcher downloads the wad. After the download is finished, Press 1 for the USA-Region EVC or press 2 for the PAL-Region EVC. After pressing 1 or 2, hit Enter.
1. In the directory of EVCPatcher should be file named "EverybodyVotesChannel(USA-RiiConnect24).wad" or EverybodyVotesChannel(EUR-RiiConnect24).wad". If not, re-run the patcher. Copy that file to your SD Card to the folder "wad". If that folder is not present on your SD Card, create it. 
1. Insert your SD card into your Wii, open the Homebrew Channel, and launch Wii Mod Lite.
1. Using the +Control Pad on your Wii Remote, go to `WAD Manager`, and then navigate to the `WAD` folder.
1. When the Everybody Votes Channel WAD is highlighted, press A to install the WAD.
1. If you get an error saying a title with a higher version is already installed (error -1035), go back to the WAD selection menu and press - on the highlighted Everybody Votes Channel WAD, then try installing it again.
1. After they are successfully installed, press the HOME Button to exit back to the Homebrew Channel.
