Disconnect24 is a revived WiiConnect24 service for modern-day Wiis. While it is a work in progress, it offers extremely stable and secure mail right now, and its very own beta channel as well!  

[Visit the Disconnect24 website](https://disconnect24.xyz/) for status updates, blogs and more information

Disconnect24 is working on Wii U support, but it isn't finished yet - so only use this on a real Wii.
<br>
Mail is currently the only stable and working part of Disconnect24, but check the [stats page](https://disconnect24.xyz/status) for updates!
<br>

In order to install Disconnect24 you must be on Wii Menu version 4.3, otherwise mail won't work.

You will now patch your WiiConnect24 configuration file. This is required to use Wii Mail.

1. Install WiiXplorer and launch it from the Homebrew Channel.
1. Go to `Start`, then go to `Settings` -> `Boot Settings` and select the "Enable NAND write access". Accept the dialog boxes, since these are warning you about potentially modifying system files - don't worry, Disconnect24 won't damage your Wii! (Thanks to RiiConnect24 for the image.)

1. Select the NAND icon, where the SD Card was, then select `SD`.
1. Press the + button in an empty area of the SD card and select the `Paste` option.

1. Choose your `nwc24msg.cfg` file on your SD card, then select `UPLOAD AND PATCH!`.

1. Open WiiXplorer again, then in the SD card section press + on nwc24msg.cfg and select `Copy`.
