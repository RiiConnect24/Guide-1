## What is Homebrew?

[**Homebrew**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_homebrew_video_games) usually refers to software that is not authorized by Nintendo. It allows you to run homebrew games, tools like save editing and backup, and emulators for various older systems.

In most cases, running homebrew on your device is 100% free using the LetterBomb or Wilbrand exploit. There are also various other exploits in commercial games and the browser to get homebrew running.
