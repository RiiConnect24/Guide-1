RiiTag is a customizable and dynamic gamertag. By sharing your gamertag (a dynamic image), you can show what you've been playing to your friends! You connect it to a USB Loader, and the tag updates on-the-fly. You need a Discord account in order to start using RiiTag.

#### What you need

* A computer
* A text editor
* A USB Loader

#### Instructions

##### Section I - Getting Started

1. [Go to the RiiTag site.](https://tag.rc24.xyz/)
1. Click `Log In` and log in with your Discord account.
1. A dialog will pop up asking you if you want to authorize `RiiConnect24 Login` with Discord. Click `Authorize`.
1. Click `Edit Your Tag` and customize it to how you like. You can add a background, overlay, flag, nickname, Wii Number, and manually enter in games to show on your tag (not needed if you're using a USB Loader).
1. Click `Show Key` and make note of the key shown. This is not needed if you're using USB Loader GX, as the key will be in a downloadable file.
1. Click `Submit` to save your changes.

Do not share your RiiTag key with anyone! If you do, people can abuse your tag.
