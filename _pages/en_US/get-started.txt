These instructions will assume you're using an SD card to mod your Wii with, but you can use a USB storage device instead. However, the exploit LetterBomb requires a SD card due to how the Wii Message Board works.

This guide is for the original Wii only, with the latest firmware (4.3). Do not use this on a Wii U (vWii)!
