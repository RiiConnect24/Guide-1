<a name="faq_latestfw" />**Q:** *I am on the latest system version. Is my device hackable?*
**A:** Yes. In fact, there are exploits available for every version except for 1.0.

<a name="faq_wiiu" />**Q:** *I am using Wii Mode (vWii) on a Wii U. Can I softmod it?*
**A:** Yes, you may use a commercial game exploit to mod your vWii. However, we recommend following the guide made for vWii: https://wiiuguide.xyz/#/vwii/vwii-modding

<a name="faq_risky" />**Q:** *How risky is hacking my console?*
**A:** Bricks (a state where either some parts of your Wii software are not working, or your Wii is not working at all) are now *basically* impossible unless you ignore/circumvent all safety checks.

<a name="faq_support" />**Q:** *Where should I go for support?*
**A:** For support, either email us at support@riiconnect24.net or join the [RiiConnect24 Discord Server](https://discord.gg/b4Y7jfD).

<a name="faq_le4gbsd" />**Q:** *What are the SD card requirements and/or recommendations?*
**A:** You will need an SD card with at least 128MB to run an exploit.

- If you are using the LetterBomb/Wilbrand exploit, your SD card should be no larger than 32 GB.
- If you are using the Super Smash Bros Brawl exploit, your SD card should be no bigger than 2 GB.

To store homebrew applications, we recommend an SD card with atleast 2 GB.

<a name="faq_nopc" />**Q:** *Can I do this without a computer (e.g. an Android phone)?*
**A:** All you need is the ability to put files on an SD card and an Internet connection!

<a name="faq_error" />**Q:** *I got error XXXXXX, how to fix it??*
**A:** In order to check what error that is, please visit the [Wiimmfi error page](https://wiimmfi.de/error).

<a name="faq_wiimini" />**Q:** *Can I mod my Wii Mini?*
**A:** You can mod your Wii Mini with a new exploit called "Bluebomb".

<a name="faq_dolphin" />**Q:** *Can I install RiiConnect24 on Dolphin?*
**A:** We've developed a program that downloads the News and Forecast information for Dolphin, which is available for download [here](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/.VFF-File-Downloader-for-Dolphin/releases/latest), simply extract it into a folder and run `Install.bat`. You have the option to either run it manually each time to update the files or have it run every hour in the background. This program does not consume many resources.

Unafortunately, all the other channels do not work at the moment because Dolphin doesn't have code to emulate WiiConnect24.
