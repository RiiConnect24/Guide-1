Have you wanted to use the News or Forecast Channel, exchange mail between Wiis, even vote on polls, and miss WiiConnect24 after shutdown? [RiiConnect24](https://rc24.xyz/) allows you to replace the built-in WiiConnect24 system.

As it stands, RiiConnect24 will not support the Wii U for the foreseeable future, so please do not install it on a Wii U yet.
<br>
So far only the News, Forecast, and Everybody Votes channels work, but check [their stats page](https://rc24.xyz/stats/index.html) for further developments.
{: .notice--warning}

In order to install RiiConnect24 you must be on Wii Menu version 4.3, otherwise mail is less likely to work.

These instructions will assume you're using an SD card to install RiiConnect24, but you can use a USB storage device in place of an SD card if you want.

##### Section I - Patching IOS

[Do you have any problems with installing RiiConnect24 or do you want to ask us something? Mail us at: support@riiconnect24.net!](mailto:support@riiconnect24.net)
{: .notice--info}

[If you want to see detailed instructions on how to install patched IOS and the patched Everybody Votes Channel after you download it, click here!](wiimodlite)
{: .notice--info}

You will now patch your IOS, `IOS31` and `IOS80`. This is required to use the Channels we support to change an RSA key used to sign the files, and contains some patches for Wii Mail. You also will download a patched version of the Everybody Votes Channel.

1. Open the IOS Patcher .zip and run `patch.bat` if on Windows, or `patch.sh` on Linux or MacOS. (If you downloaded it using cmd.exe, skip this step)
1. Follow the instructions it gives you. Upon it finishing, copy the `WAD` folder to your SD Card.
1. You should get the Everybody Votes Channel. It needs to be installed **even if you already have the Everybody Votes Channel on your Wii, because you will need a patched WAD you reinstall with**.
1. Go to the 1st Google result (the one with "We Hack Wii" in its title) that shows up when you clicked the link for the Everybody Votes Channel in the "What you need" section.
1. Look at the orange text in the header of the site saying "Can't find it here"? Click the link that says to go to a repo.
1. You should see a folder with Channels in it. It might be overwhelming, but it has links to Channels that are hard to find. If you don't know what you're doing, **don't go crazy and install them, especially foreign Channels or ones you don't know what they do**.
1. Go to the "Everybody Votes Channel" folder, then go to "Patched". Download the WAD corresponding to your Wii's region.
1. Copy the Everybody Votes Channel WAD you downloaded to the WAD folder you put on our SD Card.
1. Extract Wii Mod Lite and WiiXplorer, and then copy them to the `apps` folder on your SD Card. Make sure to copy WiiXplorer as its own folder, not the standalone files inside.
1. Insert your SD card into your Wii, open the Homebrew Channel, and launch Wii Mod Lite.
1. Using the +Control Pad on your Wii Remote, go to `WAD Manager`, and then navigate to the `WAD` folder.
1. When `IOS31.wad` is highlighted, press +, and then do the same for `IOS80.wad` and the Everybody Votes Channel WAD.
1. If you get an error saying a title with a higher version is already installed (error -1035), go back to the WAD selection menu and press - on the highlighted Everybody Votes Channel WAD, then try installing it again.
1. After they are successfully installed, press the HOME Button to exit back to the Homebrew Channel.

##### Section II - Patching nwc24msg.cfg
