The Homebrew Channel is where you will go to launch homebrew applications. BootMii is a piece of software that can backup and restore your Wii's NAND storage, and if installed in boot2, provides brick protection.

5. Once installed, press back and go to BootMii.
6. If the main screen says you can install BootMii as boot2, do so. This offers the best possible brick protection you can have. Skip this step if you cannot install BootMii as boot2.
7. Install BootMii as IOS, even if you already installed BootMii boot2 in the previous step. If you couldn't install BootMii as boot2 in the previous step, this will still allow you to create a NAND backup.

If you do not have an SD card, you cannot install or use BootMii, and therefore will not be able utilize any of the mentioned benefits. You can always install it at a later date.
