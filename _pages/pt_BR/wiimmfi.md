[Wiimmfi](https://wiimmfi.de) é um serviço destinado a substituir o extinto Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Foi desenvolvido por Wiimm e Leseratte.

## Tipos de patchers

Existem muitos métodos diferentes para se conectar ao Wiimmfi.

### Aplicativo Homebrew (Disco)
MrBean35000vr (criador do CTGP-R, um mod para o Mario Kart Wii) criou o Wiimmfi Disc Patcher, que permite que você insira um disco e jogue com patch do Wiimmfi rapidamente, o ponto negativo é que é necessário fazer isso toda vez que decidir jogar no Wiimmfi.

#### Você precisará de
* Um cartão SD ou pendrive
* [Auto Wiimmfi Patcher](/assets/files/autowiimmfipatcher-0.6.zip)

#### Instruções

1. Extraia o Auto Wiimmfi Patcher e coloque dentro da pasta `apps `do seu Cartão SD ou USB.
2. Insira seu Cartão SD ou USB no Wii e inicie o Auto Wiimmfi Patcher pelo Homebrew Channel.
3. Insira o disco do jogo (você pode inseri-lo antes ou depois da inicialização, não importa).
4. Aguarde o patch ser concluído e o jogo irá iniciar!

### Sem Homebrew (Disco)
Graças ao exploit str2hax do Fullmetal5's, Leseratte foi capaz de adaptá-lo ao patcher do Wiimmfi, isso permite que você jogue no Wiimmfi sem ter nenhum homebrew no seu console.

#### Você precisará de
* Um Wii conectado à internet

#### Instruções

1. Insira o disco do jogo.
2. Vá até as configurações de internet do console e defina o servidor DNS para 95.217.77.151.
3. Vá para as informações do contrato do WC24 (terceiro botão depois de clicar em "Internet" nas configurações).
4. Confirme que você deseja usar o WC24 e o canal da loja do Wii
5. A página de patch do Wiimmfi deve aparecer. Caso contrário, e você ainda veja o contrato de licença padrão, seu roteador pode ser incompatível com este método.
6. Espera por volta de 1 minuto e 30 segundos até que o patcher carregue
7. O jogo agora deve começar com o patch Wiimmfi incluído

### Patch da IOS
You may not want to run a patcher each time you want to play on Wiimmfi, and maybe you already use a USB Loader. As such, ISO Patchers were created, some for specific games.

#### What you need
- Your copy of your game (WBFS, ISO, cISO, and other forms that a Wii can use are supported).
- [RiiConnect24 Patcher](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/RiiConnect24-Patcher/releases/) (Windows only)  
**or**
- Wiimm's ISO Patcher (cross platform)
   - [Patcher for Mario Kart Wii](http://download.wiimm.de/wiimmfi/patcher/mkw-wiimmfi-patcher-v6.zip)
   - [Patcher for all other games](http://download.wiimm.de/wiimmfi/patcher/wiimmfi-patcher-v4.7z)
- A USB Loader, [cIOS](cios), and a USB to store the game on (you should already have these if you're using a USB Loader)

#### Instructions
1. Extract the patcher of your choice to a folder, and place your copy of the game in it.
2. Run the patch script for your OS: usually it will end in `.bat` for Windows and `.sh` for Mac/Linux. If you're using the RiiConnect24 Patcher, select your device (Wii, vWii, or Dolphin) and choose the patcher for your game.
3. Once it's finished, get the version out of the `wiimmfi-images` folder (it may be in the folder outside of the patcher - ../wiimmfi-images) and copy it back to your USB.

### Automatic patching from the Disc Channel using Priiloader

#### What you need
- A Wii with Priiloader 0.9 or later installed

If you have an older version of Priiloader, follow [this guide](priiloader) to update.
{: .notice--info}

#### Instructions
1. Hold reset while powering on your Wii (if using a Wii mini, plug in a USB keyboard and press escape).
2. Go to `System Menu Hacks`.
3. Make sure the `Wiimmfi patch v2` hack is enabled.
4. Save settings and exit.

### Automatic patching using a USB-Loader
If you are already using USB Loader GX, try updating it to the most recent version. Then, there should be a "private server" setting (both in the global loader options and in the game options) which you can set to "Wiimmfi" to make the USB Loader automatically patch every game you start to work with Wiimmfi.

### WiiWare Patching
You can patch WiiWare games in order to play them on Wiimmfi.

#### What you need

- An SD card
- Your copy of your game (in WAD format)
- [RiiConnect24 Patcher](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/RiiConnect24-Patcher/releases/) (Windows only)  
**or**
- [Auto WiiWare Patcher](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/auto-wiiware-patcher/releases) (cross platform)
- [Wii Mod Lite](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/Wii-Mod-Lite/releases)

Steps:
1. Extract the .zip of the latest version of Auto WiiWare Patcher, and put your WAD in it.
2. Run the patch script for your OS: usually it will end in `.bat` for Windows and `.sh` for Mac/Linux. If you're using the RiiConnect24 Patcher, select your device (Wii, vWii, or Dolphin) and choose the WiiWare patcher.
3. If it completed successfully, install the WAD that was made in `wiiware-wads` with Wii Mod Lite.

## Other stuff

### Mario Kart Wii Competitions
Wiimmfi allows you to participate in Mario Kart Wii competitions again.

#### What you need

- An SD card or USB drive
- Mario Kart Wii Competition Patcher
   - [Wii](https://competitions.wiimmfi.de/competition-tool-wii.zip)
   - [Wii U (vWii)](https://competitions.wiimmfi.de/competition-tool-wiiu.zip)

#### Instructions (for Wii)

1. Extract Mario Kart Wii Competition Patcher and put it in the `apps` folder on your SD Card.
2. Insert your SD card or USB drive into the Wii.
3. Launch the original Mario Kart Wii game (not Wiimmfi patched).
4. Navigate to Settings -> Network Settings (or Nintendo WFC Connection) -> Message Service. If you turned the message service feature on, turn it off and turn it on again.
5. Launch Mario Kart Wii Competition Patcher.
6. The patcher will look for save files for Mario Kart Wii on your storage device in various places, and upload them. This is done in case a missing competition is found in your save file. It will also, of course, patch your Wii for competitions.

If you're using the Wii U, you will have to run the competitions patcher whenever you want to check for a competition, because WiiConnect24 is not enabled on the Wii U.

### DS Games
Wiimmfi doesn't only support Wii games, it supports lots of DS games too. Thanks to an exploit called nds-constraint, you can play DS games without patching your games.

#### What you need

- A Wi-Fi network with WEP or no security

Getting a Wi-Fi network with WEP or no security is the hardest part, because DS games don't support newer Wi-Fi security types (unless it's one of the few games that are "DSi Enhanced" and can use your Wi-Fi configuration on your DSi or 3DS, like Pokémon Black/White). However, many routers support creating a guest Wi-Fi connection, or you can make a hotspot on your phone or your computer. There are plenty of resources on the Internet that have information on this, so use your favorite search engine to find them.

#### Instructions

1. Go in the Nintendo DS Wi-Fi settings. This can be accessed inside the game you want to play online with.
2. Set up a connection.
3. Type in `164.132.44.106` as the primary DNS.
4. Type in `1.1.1.1` as the secondary DNS (if it gives you problems, try `8.8.8.8`).
5. Save your connection settings and perform a connection test. If it's successful, then you're ready to play.

### CTGP-R (Mario Kart Wii)
MrBean35000vr and Chadderz have an amazing CTGP-R distribution, the application that allows you to use a set of custom tracks, has automatic Wiimmfi patching. Go to the [ChadSoft Website](http://chadsoft.co.uk) for the download and instructions.

### MKW Hack Pack (Mario Kart Wii)
Huili has put together a really good collection of custom tracks and hacks called MKW Hack Pack, and allows connections to Wiimmfi. To learn how to set it up, go to the [wiki page](http://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/MKW_Hack_Pack).

### Wiimms MKW Fun (Mario Kart Wii)
Wiimm and Leseratte created a custom track distribution called "Wiimms MKW Fun", which gets updated about three times a year. It is based on the LE-CODE framework by Leseratte and contains a Wiimmfi patch and lots of other features. You can find out more about it on its [wiki page](http://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Wiimms_Mario_Kart_Fun).
