![BombaBlu](/images/bluebomb.png)

Bluebomb is an exploit intended for Wii Mini Modding that takes advantage of an exploit in the Bluetooth adapter. It's the only exploit for the Wii Mini but it can be used on the original Wii as well. It can be used to recover from certain bricks on the Wii.

For the original Wii, we recommend using [another exploit](/get-started) instead if you intend to install the Homebrew Channel
{: .notice--info}

If installing on the Wii Mini; BootMii can't be installed on the Wii Mini yet. Please don't attempt to install it. We won't be responsible if your device gets bricked.
{: .notice--warning}
This exploit will not work on a Wii U (vWii). Please follow [this guide instead](https://wiiuguide.xyz/#/vwii/).
{: .notice--warning}

#### What you need
- A Linux machine with a Bluetooth adapter (an integrated one will work)
  - If you are using a Chromebook, you do not need to install another Operating System. You can enable [Linux in ChromeOS](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439?hl=en)
  - Using Windows Subsystem for Linux will not work, due to the inability to access `bluetoothctl`.
  - If you do not have Linux, Ubuntu is the most user-friendly option
    - 32-bit devices will require [Ubuntu 16.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/)
    - We recommend the LTS edition due to its stability, but the current release works as well.
- USB Drive

#### Instructions
##### Section I - Performing the exploit
1. Open the Linux Terminal.
2. Disable the Bluetooth Service; `sudo systemctl disable --now bluetooth`
3. Make a new folder for Bluebomb; `mkdir bluebomb`
4. Navigate to that directory in the terminal; `cd bluebomb`
5. Download the pre-built binaries; `wget https://github.com/Fullmetal5/bluebomb/releases/download/1.5/bluebomb1.5.zip`
6. Extract the files out of the archive; `unzip bluebomb1.5.zip`
7. Plug the USB into your PC
8. Download the files from [the BootMii website](https://bootmii.org/download/)
9. Extract the contents of the `hackmii_installer_v1.2` folder to the USB
10. Eject the USB from the PC and plug into the Wii
   - If you're on a normal Wii with two USB slots, plug it in the top one
11. Turn the Wii on and do not pair a Wiimote. You can leave it on the Wii Heath and Safety Screen or System Menu
12. In the terminal, type these commands to specific Wii Regions: `sudo ./bluebomb [a] ./stage0/MINI_SM_[b].bin stage1.bin`
  - If you are using an external USB Bluetooth Adapter (if the PC had Bluetooth built-in and you wish to use an external adapter instead), replace [a] with 1
    - Otherwise, leave it blank
  - If you use a PAL region, replace [b] with `PAL`. Likewise, if you use an NTSC console, replace [b] with `NTSC`

The Terminal should now print "Waiting to accept". The computer is now waiting for a connection from your Wii Mini.

13. Inizia premendo il `Sync` Tasto (Il tasto di sincronizzazione della Wii mini è sul lato sinistro. Sulla Wii normale, è a destra dello slot della scheda SD)
   - Continue Pressing until Terminal displays "Got connection handle".

The Wii Mini should now boot to the HackMii installer (Do not attempt to install BootMii)

[Continue to Homebrew Channel and BootMii Installation](hbc)

##### Section II - cIOS Installation
cIOS is used for USB Loaders to play backups. Be warned that cIOS is still in the experimental stage.
{: .notice--info}
This version of cIOS is only for the Wii Mini. If you're on a Wii, please follow the [cIOS guide](/cios).
{: .notice--warning}

1. Download the cIOS File from [here](https://bluebomb.glitch.me/d2xl-cIOS/index.html)
2. Open the archive and drag and drop the only folder to the `/apps/` folder on your USB Drive
3. Open the Homebrew Channel on your Wii Mini
4. Launch the d2x cIOS installer
5. For `Select cIOS`, change the value to `d2xl-v1-beta2`
6. For `Select cIOS base`, change the value to `57`
7. For `Select cIOS slot` and change the value to `249`
   - Under "NOTES" there will be a section "Offline installation". Take a note of the exact version number (5 digits directly before the `.wad` extension).
8. Press A to start the installation.
   - If it fails with a weird "TMD version mismatch" error, that isn't a problem. Just try again, but this time, while selecting the cIOS base, press left/right on the Wiimote until the 5-digit number from earlier is different than when you tried before. This time, it should work - one of the two version numbers should work.
9. After successfully installing the cIOS press B to exit.

Now you have cIOS installed.

##### Section III - Enabling Ethernet

Do not run this section if you're not on a Wii Mini. This section is **only** intended for Wii Mini owners.
{: .notice--warning}

1. Download [the Wii Mini Ethernet Enable tool](/assets/files/Wii_Mini_Ethernet_Enable.zip).
2. Add it to the `/apps/` folder on your USB.
3. Run it from the Homebrew Channel.

Ethernet should work now.
